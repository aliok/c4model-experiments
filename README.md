These are my experiments on C4model with Structurizr. 

* `structurizr-java-quickstart`: Quick start Structurizr Java DSL. Shows how to push diagrams to local or public servers.

* `structurizr-cli-example`: Uses Structurizr DSL to export to PlantUML and C4PlantUML formats. Also shows how to push to local or public servers.

* `devcontainer`: Uses a VsCode devcontainer. Syntax highlighting works but the diagram preview doesn't.
